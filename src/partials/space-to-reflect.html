        Even with all the help that Savvyy provides, the job search can be
        overwhelming. The journal gives you a private space to reflect on each
        day's ups and downs. Writing even a few sentences every day helps to
        keep you focused and determined â€” even when the times are tough.

        Savvyy can even send you a daily reminder to help you maintain this
        important practice.
