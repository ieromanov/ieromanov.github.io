        Remember that your career is a marathon, not a sprint that ends when you
        land your next job. Savvyy gives you the tools to cultivate both your
        network and industry knowledge, allowing you to stay competitive and
        upwardly mobile.

        <b>Pricing:</b> Once you land your next opportunity, we ask you for a one-time $100. If you decide to continue using Savvyy after that (and we very much hope you would), it will be $5 per month.
